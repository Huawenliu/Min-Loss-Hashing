= Trainer =

For MLH to work, the hash function requires training.

INPUT:
  * feature vectors
        List[ Vector[(String,Double)] ]    (feature, weight)
  * pairwise similarity scores
        List[(Int,Int,Double)]             (id1, id2, score)
    
OUTPUT:
  * a map from features to IDs
        Map[String,Int]               (feature, ID)
  * hyperplanes
        Vector[ Vector[Double] ]      weights


= Sketcher =

The Sketcher is initialized with the output from the Trainer.  Given a
feature vector of type Vector[(String,Double)], it outputs a sketch
(hashcode).


= Indexer =

Run the Hasher over each feature vector to produce a sketch for each.
Store them in MongoDB.  Supports online updates -- given a novel
feature vector, it adds its sketch to the index.


= Searcher =

The Searcher is initialized with the index produced by the Indexer.
Given the ID of an already-indexed feature vector, it returns a list
of IDs of its nearest neighbors.


== Schedule ==

The Trainer is by far the most complicated piece of logic and will
take the lion's share of the time.

= Week 1 =
+ Trivial Sketcher, using fake (randomly generated) Trainer output
+ Indexer, using Trivial Sketcher

= Week 2 =
+ Searcher

= Weeks 3,4 =
+ Trainer
